The latest release of the [Service Catalog](https://github.com/clearwind-ca/service-catalog) includes timezone support, improved <a href="https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/74699/241323475-ebe62627-b759-435f-9bf3-5bed05e5b41a.png">health check result visibility</a> and JSON5 compatibility.

Writing `catalog.json` files in the repositories just got easier, because using <a href="https://json5.org/">JSON5</a> allows comments, trailing commas and other things that make JSON annoying to write sometimes. Timezone support allows users to see date stamps relative to the current time, in UTC and their chosen timezone. Making life that bit easier in incidents.
