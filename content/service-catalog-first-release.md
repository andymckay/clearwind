We are pleased to announce the **first open source release** of the [Service Catalog](https://github.com/clearwind-ca/service-catalog).

As organisations grow in complexity, it can be increasingly hard to understand what's happening in the organisation and who is doing what. The service catalog is an open source tool to allow you to get <b>insight on your services</b>, how they interconnect, their health and <b>reduce your downtime</b>.
